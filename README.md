# 🚧 Traffic Accidents Analysis in the UK

This project focuses on **analyzing and modeling the causes and effects of traffic accidents in the United Kingdom**, using data-driven techniques. It involves both **exploratory data analysis** (EDA) and **machine learning model training** to understand and predict the factors that most influence traffic incidents.

## 📁 Files in This Repository

- `APP.ipynb`:  
  Contains **data preprocessing**, **feature engineering**, and **model training** steps.  
  Multiple machine learning models are trained and compared to determine the most suitable one for this problem.

- `APP (2).ipynb`:  
  Focuses on **data analysis and visualization**. This notebook explores the dataset to uncover patterns and relationships (e.g., time of day, weather, lighting, road type, etc.) that affect traffic accident frequency and severity.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze traffic accident data in the UK.
- Identify key factors influencing traffic incidents.
- Visualize trends over time, location, and conditions.
- Train and compare machine learning models to classify or predict accident severity or frequency.

## 📊 Visualizations

- Heatmaps
- Histograms
- Correlation plots
- Time-series line graphs
- Pie and bar charts for categorical factors

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models

In `APP.ipynb`, various models are trained and evaluated, such as:

- Linear Regression
- Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Model performance is compared using:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
